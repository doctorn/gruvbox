## Introduction

The inspiration for iro was essentially just to create a friendlier version of [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). All of the syntax highlighting definitions have been taken directly from the gruvbox repository so all credit goes to the original authors. All of the colours have been brightened and centered around the blue part of the colour wheel (as opposed to the yellow part). You'll notice one or two of the colours remain unchanged (notably the orange), but the rest have been replaced.

As with gruvbox, there is compatability with the airline plugin; however, compatability with lightline has been removed.

For terminal specific installation and configuration instructions, for now just follow the instructions on [the gruvbox repository](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). At some point I will post some here.
